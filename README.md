# Abnormal-Normal Backpain Analysis


## 📜 Project Overview

Back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide, impacting millions of lives and creating significant personal, economic, and social burdens. This project, **Abnormal-Normal Backpain Analysis**, aims to:
- Identify patterns in back pain data.
- Distinguish between normal and abnormal back pain.
- Develop predictive models for better diagnosis and management.

**Alignment with SDG 3**: Good Health and Well-being. By leveraging data analytics, this project contributes to improving diagnostics, personalized care, and overall health outcomes.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Accuracy**: 88.7%
- **ROC AUC**: 0.9625
- **Significant Features**: Pelvic Tilt, Sacral Slope, Pelvic Radius, Degree of Spondylolisthesis.

### Key Observations
- **Pelvic Incidence**: Values ≥ 100 strongly correlate with abnormal back pain.
- **Pelvic Tilt**: Values > 30 often indicate abnormal spinal status.
- **Sacral Slope**: High values (> 70) are potential indicators of abnormal spine conditions.
